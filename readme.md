Hello! This is the Comet Computer Science Project, the College Task Manager. 

This is from Lydia and Neha's group, coded by Timothy and the assistance of ChatGPT. 
Most of the Javascript and interactive part was made by ChatGPT and a basic design modeled by Timothy. 

We couldn't get all the aspects of our project done because of a shortage of coders in the group, but we managed to get a main idea and task manager running and working. 

It includes the task name, difficulty, and due date. You can delete and alter the task as you like.
